      <h2>what is html?</h2>
      <p>this is my writing.many peoples often use html to produce thier own wep pages therefore it is a very important web editor.</p>
      <strong> "p tags" to make paragraphs</strong></p>
      <br><p>the reason for this is because the letter p stands for paragraphs</p>
      <p>and we also use "br" for making a new line for the <strong>paragraphs</strong></p><br>
      <p>today we learned about somg tags we need when we are <u>making web pages</u></p>
